1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:02,353
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,992
Don't anybody move!

3
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:06,992
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:08,952
Money, money, money!

5
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:10,232
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:44,233
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,352
Help! Baal
Help us!

8
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:49,791
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:58,872
Reach for the sky!

10
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,071
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,751
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:06,151
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,871
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:09,070
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:12,351
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,190
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,230
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,030
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,509
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:36,029
You're my favorite deputy.

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,469
You've got a friend in me

22
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,309
You've got a friend in me

23
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:44,109
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,149
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:50,948
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,188
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,948
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,787
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:58,908
Yee-haw!

30
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:01,708
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,707
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:07,227
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:09,347
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:10,347
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:11,427
Maybe

36
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:16,187
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,947
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:20,227
And as the years go by

39
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,987
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:22,346 --> 00:02:24,867
Our friendship will never die

41
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:29,786
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,145
You've got a friend in me

43
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,306
All right!

44
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,705
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,105
Score!

46
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,346
You got a friend in me

47
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,505
Wow! Cool!

48
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:44,586
- What do you think?
- Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,146
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:47,985
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,065
- I hope I have enough places.
- Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,664
- One, two... Four.
- Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,305
- Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
- Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,225
- Well, sure! We can leave it up.
- Yeah!

55
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,305
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,065
Okay. It's party time, Woody.

57
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,864
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,703
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,784
<i>Somebody's poisoned the water hole.</i>

60
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:19,423
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,544
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,703
See you later, Woody.

63
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,423
Pull my string!
The birthday party's today?

64
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:38,142
Okay, everybody,
coast is clear!

65
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,022
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

66
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,862
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

67
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,461
Hey, Hamm.

68
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,540
- Look, I'm Picasso!
- I don't get it.

69
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,940
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

70
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,860
- Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
- Sir! No, sir!

71
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,740
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,341
Hey, uh, Slinky?

73
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,140
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,339
- No. Slink...
- Oh, well, all right.

75
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,540
You can be red if you want.

76
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,579
- Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
- Bad news?

77
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,739
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

78
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,780
Got it.

79
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,099
Be happy!

80
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:42,738
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

81
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,659
Hey.

82
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,338
Hey, Etch. Draw!

83
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,379
Oh! Got me again.

84
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,979
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

85
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,898
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

86
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,538
Now, where is that... Oh.

87
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:05,018
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

88
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:10,457
- How're you doin', Rex?
- Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

89
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:12,338
I was close to being scared
that time.

90
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:15,857
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

91
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,137
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

92
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:21,697
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

93
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,257
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

94
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,936
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

95
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:31,136
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

96
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,296
Oh, yeah!

97
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,497
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

98
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,297
- Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
- Come on, come on.

99
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,616
Smaller toys up front.

100
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:45,336
Hey, Woody, come on.

101
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,535
Oh, thanks, Mike.

102
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,615
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

103
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:57,135
- For crying out loud.
- Thank you.

104
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:01,335
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

105
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,334
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

106
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:07,374
Okay. First item today...

107
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,615
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

108
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,175
- What?
- Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

109
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:15,414
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

110
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:17,774
Do we have to hold hands?

111
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:20,013
You guys think this is a big joke.

112
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:22,414
We've only got one week
left before the move.

113
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:25,373
! don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

114
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:27,894
If you don't have one, get one!

115
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,813
All right, next. Oh, yes.

116
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:34,053
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

117
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,412
was, I think, a big success.

118
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:39,533
And we wanna thank Mr. Spell
for putting that on for us.

119
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,133
- Thank you, Mr. Spell.
- You're welcome.

120
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:45,493
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

121
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,092
<i>Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.</i>

122
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,812
Wait a minute here!

123
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:52,892
What do you mean the party's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

124
00:06:52,973 --> 00:06:55,492
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

125
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:59,172
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party before the move.

126
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,932
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

127
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,452
Of course Woody ain't worried.

128
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:04,492
He's been Andy's favorite
since kindergarten.

129
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,772
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

130
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:10,251
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

131
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,491
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

132
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,051
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

133
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,011
But what if Andy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

134
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,970
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

135
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:24,251
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

136
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,131
This is Andy
we're talking about.

137
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,131
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

138
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,209
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

139
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,250
That's what we're made for, right?

140
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,930
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

141
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,689
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

142
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,809
Stay calm, everyone!

143
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,249
Hey!

144
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,209
Meeting adjourned.

145
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,609
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

146
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,969
I can't see a thing.

147
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,969
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

148
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,768
- Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

149
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,848
- They're all in boxes, you idiot.
- They're getting bigger.

150
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:09,128
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

151
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,168
Hi!

152
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,167
- Spell, trash can.
- We're doomed!

153
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,888
All right! All right!

154
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:20,527
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

155
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,288
- Yes! Yes! We promise!
- Okay! Save your batteries.

156
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,287
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

157
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,606
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

158
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:35,047
- You know what to do.
- Yes, sir!

159
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,847
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

160
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:41,167
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

161
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,247
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

162
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,525
Yeah!

163
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,605
Okay, come on, kids.

164
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:09,485
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

165
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:32,324
All right, gangway, gangway.

166
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,443
And this is how we find out

167
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,644
what is in those presents.

168
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:44,083
Okay, who's hungry?

169
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,083
Here come the chips!

170
00:09:46,123 --> 00:09:48,483
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

171
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,443
What in the world... Oh!

172
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,803
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

173
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,402
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

174
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:59,443
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

175
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,362
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

176
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,041
Go on without me!
Just go!

177
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,801
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

178
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,921
Okay, everybody, come on.

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,839
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

180
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,560
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,480
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

182
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,439
- Mine!
- There they are.

183
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,199
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

184
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,479
- This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
- Come in, Mother Bird.

185
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,519
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

186
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,319
Mrs. Potato Head! Mrs. Potato Head!
Mrs. Potato Head!

187
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,758
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

188
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,239
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

189
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,719
It's a... If's...
It's a... a lunch box.

190
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,918
- We've got a lunch box here.
- A lunch box?

191
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,718
- Lunch box?
- For lunch.

192
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,199
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

193
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,998
- Okay, it's bed sheets.
- Who invited that kid?

194
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,037
Oh! Only one left.

195
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,758
- Okay, we're on the last present now.
- Last present!

196
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,117
It's a big one. It's a...

197
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,637
- It's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
- Whew!

198
00:11:32,677 --> 00:11:34,836
Hallelujah!

199
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,718
- Yeah! All right!
- Hey, watch it!

200
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,477
Sorry there, old spud head.

201
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:42,157
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

202
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,476
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

203
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:47,837
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

204
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,116
Wait a minute. Oh!

205
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:54,117
- What do we have here?
- Wait! Turn that thing back on!

206
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:55,917
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

207
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,596
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

208
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,996
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

209
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,916
- Mom, what is it?
- It's a huge package.

210
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,796
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

211
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,715
- It's a...
- Wow!

212
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,075
It's a what? What is it?

213
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,874
- Oh, no!
- Oh, ya big lizard!

214
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:18,475
- Now we'll never know what it is!
- Way to go, Rex!

215
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,435
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

216
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:22,915
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

217
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:25,955
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

218
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:29,434
Let's go to my room, guys!

219
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:32,194
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

220
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,195
- There!
- Juvenile intrusion!

221
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,994
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

222
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:38,593
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

223
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,634
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

224
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:42,914
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

225
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,954
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

226
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:59,312
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

227
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:02,552
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

228
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:04,672
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

229
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,552
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

230
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,592
We've got prizes!

231
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:22,392
- What is it?
- Can you see it?

232
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:26,151
- What the heck is up there?
- Woody, who's up there with ya?

233
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,312
Woody?

234
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,151
- What are you doing under the bed?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

235
00:13:32,191 --> 00:13:34,751
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

236
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,470
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

237
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:41,190
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

238
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,350
- Have you been replaced?
- What did I tell you earlier?

239
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,150
No one is getting replaced.

240
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,789
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

241
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,389
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

242
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,069
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

243
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,988
Come in, Star Command.

244
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,828
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

245
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:27,029
Why don't they answer? My ship!

246
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,827
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

247
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:36,348
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

248
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:39,587
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 12.

249
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,067
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

250
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,547
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

251
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:49,187
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

252
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,227
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

253
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:55,267
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

254
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,306
Hello!

255
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:59,546
<i>Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

256
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:01,786
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

257
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,186
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

258
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:07,985
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

259
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,705
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

260
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,986
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

261
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,266
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

262
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:18,265
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

263
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:20,425
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

264
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:24,184
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

265
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,785
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

266
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,824
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

267
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,744
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

268
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,144
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

269
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,544
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

270
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:39,224
- Do you know these life-forms?
- Yes! They're Andy's toys.

271
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,543
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

272
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:44,143
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

273
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:47,423
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

274
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:49,664
Wh-why, thank you!

275
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:52,344
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

276
00:15:52,423 --> 00:15:55,064
- Say, what's that button do?
- I'll show you.

277
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,663
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

278
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,743
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

279
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,942
- Only it's...
- Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

280
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:06,583
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

281
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:08,182
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

282
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:11,382
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

283
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:14,741
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

284
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:18,383
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

285
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:19,821
of the Space Ranger Corps,

286
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:22,462
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

287
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,462
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

288
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:28,861
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

289
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,341
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

290
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,901
I'm actually from a smaller company

291
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,381
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

292
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,861
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

293
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,580
Well, sure. Look at him.

294
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,301
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

295
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,021
Please be careful.

296
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,580
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

297
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,981
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

298
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,900
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

299
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:53,620
- What's with him?
- Laser envy.

300
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:54,900
All right, that's enough!

301
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,220
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

302
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,580
<i>- Toy?
- T-O-Y. Toy!</i>

303
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,459
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

304
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:08,819
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

305
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,339
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

306
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,339
Mr. Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

307
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,939
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

308
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,979
He's not a Space Ranger!

309
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,579
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

310
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,018
Excuse me.

311
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:27,379
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

312
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:32,019
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

313
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,418
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

314
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:38,658
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

315
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:39,698
- You can't.
- Can.

316
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,417
Can't. Can't. Can't!

317
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:43,857
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

318
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:47,898
- Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
- All right, then, I will.

319
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:49,817
Stand back, everyone!

320
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,857
To infinity and beyond!

321
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:27,696
- Can!
- Whoal!

322
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,894
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

323
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:34,895
- I found my movin' buddy.
- Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

324
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:38,695
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

325
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,775
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

326
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:45,655
- Golly bob howdy!
- Oh, shut up!

327
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,694
You know, in a couple of days,

328
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,975
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

329
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:50,653
They'll see.

330
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,973
I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

331
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,133
I was on top of the world
livin' high

332
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:59,093
It was right in my pocket

333
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,053
! was livin" the life

334
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:06,373
Things were just the way
they should be

335
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,732
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

336
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,973
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

337
00:19:15,173 --> 00:19:18,452
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

338
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,412
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

339
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:24,652
Strange

340
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:27,012
Things are happening to me

341
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:32,291
Strange

342
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:35,452
Things

343
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:40,331
Strange things are happening to me

344
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:43,330
Ain't no doubt about it

345
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:52,091
! had friends
! had lots of friends

346
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,491
Now all my friends are gone

347
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,690
And I'm doin' the best I can

348
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,490
To carry on

349
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,850
- had power
- Power

350
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,210
- I was respected
- Respected

351
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,210
But not anymore

352
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,890
And I've lost the love of the one

353
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,609
Whom I adore

354
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,889
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

355
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,609
Things are happenin'to me

356
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,569
Strange

357
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,568
Things

358
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,528
Strange

359
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:35,249
Things are happenin'to me

360
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,608
Ain't no doubt about it

361
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,688
Strange

362
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:46,088
Things

363
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:50,247
Strange

364
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:52,287
Things

365
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:55,927
Finally!

366
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:58,767
Hey, who's got my hat?

367
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:01,527
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

368
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:04,607
Gimme that!

369
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,247
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

370
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:10,126
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

371
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,006
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

372
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:14,085
Wow!

373
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,046
With permanent ink too!

374
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,646
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

375
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,166
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

376
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:26,526
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

377
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,525
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

378
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:32,845
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

379
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,645
- Yeah, like the attic.
- All right, that's it!

380
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,566
Unidirectional bonding strip.

381
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,924
Mr. Lightyear wants more tape.

382
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,525
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

383
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:51,204
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

384
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:52,725
What are you talking about?

385
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:55,244
Where's that bonding strip?

386
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:57,763
And another thing,

387
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:01,843
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

388
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:04,163
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

389
00:22:04,804 --> 00:22:08,044
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

390
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:11,842
- Don't even think about it, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah, tough guy?

391
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,362
The air isn't... toxic.

392
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:28,322
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

393
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:31,561
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

394
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:36,482
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

395
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:39,482
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

396
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:43,202
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

397
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,481
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

398
00:22:44,522 --> 00:22:47,201
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

399
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,601
Where?

400
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,441
Yes!

401
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
It's Sid!

402
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,520
Don't move!

403
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,240
I thought he was at summer camp.

404
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:07,321
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

405
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,559
Oh, no, not Sid!

406
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,161
Incoming!

407
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,120
- Who is it this time?
- I... I can't... I can't tell.

408
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,239
- Hey, where's Lenny?
- Right here, Woody.

409
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,039
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

410
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,119
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

411
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,159
What's going on?

412
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,759
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

413
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,279
I'd better take a look anyway.

414
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,718
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

415
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,959
That's why, Sid.

416
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:39,358
Sure is a hairy fellow.

417
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,398
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

418
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,759
That is Sid.

419
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,638
- You mean that happy child?
- That ain't no happy child.

420
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,798
He tortures toys, just for fun!

421
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,277
Well, then we've got
to do something.

422
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,077
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

423
00:23:58,158 --> 00:24:01,277
- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
- Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

424
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,597
Melt him with your scary laser.

425
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:06,557
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

426
00:24:06,597 --> 00:24:09,237
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

427
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,997
Look out!

428
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,517
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

429
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:21,556
I could've stopped him.

430
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:24,676
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

431
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:27,156
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

432
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:30,516
The sooner we move, the better.

433
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:32,475
Yeah!

434
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:40,195
To infinity and beyond!

435
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:43,395
All this packing
makes me hungry.

436
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,274
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

437
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:49,155
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

438
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,874
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

439
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:55,115
- Can I bring some toys?
- You can bring one toy.

440
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,034
- Just one?
- One toy?

441
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,194
Will Andy pick me?

442
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,553
"Don't count on it"?

443
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:33,313
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

444
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:35,632
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

445
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:38,272
- Trouble? Where?
- Down there. Just down there.

446
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:40,992
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

447
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,392
Then we've no time to lose.

448
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:50,072
I don't see anything!

449
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:52,312
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

450
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,591
What kind of toy...

451
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,470
Buzz!

452
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:13,710
Buzz!

453
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,790
I don't see him in the driveway.

454
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,350
- I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
- Oh! Buzz!

455
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,390
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

456
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,069
- He's saying that this was no accident.
- What do you mean?

457
00:26:30,109 --> 00:26:32,469
- I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
- No!

458
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,748
By Woody!

459
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,548
- What?
- Wait a minute.

460
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:39,749
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

461
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,749
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

462
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:44,828
Now, it was an accident, guys.

463
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,628
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

464
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:51,028
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

465
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,468
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

466
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:57,107
Where is your honor, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

467
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,707
You don't deserve to... Hey!

468
00:26:58,788 --> 00:27:01,948
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

469
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:05,948
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

470
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,308
So you got rid of him.

471
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:09,946
Well, what if Andy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

472
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,907
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

473
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:13,987
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

474
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,027
There he is, men. Frag him!

475
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:17,587
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

476
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,947
- I got dibs on his hat!
- Would you boys stop it!

477
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:20,986
Tackle him!

478
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,586
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

479
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,426
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

480
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:27,586
Retreat!

481
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,186
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

482
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:35,666
No, I haven't seen him.

483
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:41,505
- Andy, I'm heading out the door!
- But, Mom, I can't find him!

484
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,946
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

485
00:27:44,146 --> 00:27:45,905
Oh, okay.

486
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:54,065
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

487
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:56,985
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

488
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,063
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

489
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,103
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

490
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,343
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

491
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:23,183
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

492
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,102
Oh, where could he be?

493
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:39,382
- Can I help pump the gas?
- Sure! I'll even let you drive.

494
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:41,383
- Yeah?
- Yeah, when you're 16.

495
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,302
Funny, Mom.

496
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:47,622
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

497
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,022
Buzz!

498
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:57,221
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

499
00:28:57,262 --> 00:29:00,421
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

500
00:29:00,462 --> 00:29:02,902
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

501
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:07,981
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

502
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:10,540
Huh? Right? Buddy?

503
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,060
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

504
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,940
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

505
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,861
- Oh. Well, that's good.
- But we're not on my planet, are we?

506
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,900
No.

507
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:30,140
Okay, come on!

508
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,299
You want a piece of me?

509
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,499
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

510
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,378
- Next stop.
- Pizza Planet! Yeah!

511
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,018
Andy!

512
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,859
Wh... Doesn't he realize
that I'm not there?

513
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,377
I'm lost!

514
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,617
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

515
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:11,978
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

516
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,298
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refueling station of some sort.

517
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,377
Youl

518
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,815
- According to my navi-computer, the...
- Shut up!

519
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:42,095
- Just shut up, you idiot!
- Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

520
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:45,576
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

521
00:30:45,616 --> 00:30:47,775
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

522
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:50,855
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

523
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:51,975
Oh, yeah?

524
00:30:52,055 --> 00:30:55,015
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

525
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:57,135
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

526
00:30:57,215 --> 00:30:58,535
Don't talk to me
about importance!

527
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:01,535
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

528
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:03,974
What? What are
you talkin' about?

529
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:06,654
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

530
00:31:06,694 --> 00:31:08,294
has been secretly building
a weapon

531
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,494
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

532
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:15,654
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

533
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,855
And you, my friend,
are responsible

534
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:21,174
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

535
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,613
You... are... a... toy!

536
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:26,854
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

537
00:31:26,934 --> 00:31:31,493
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

538
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:35,973
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

539
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:37,173
Farewell.

540
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:40,173
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

541
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:42,533
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

542
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:46,012
- Hey, gas dude!
- You talkin' to me?

543
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:48,453
- Yeah, man. Can you help me?
- Pizza Planet? Andy!

544
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,411
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

545
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,812
Oh, no!

546
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:54,652
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

547
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:57,531
- Buzz! Buzz, come back!
- Go away!

548
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:00,811
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! ll...

549
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,892
I found a spaceship!

550
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,491
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

551
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,371
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

552
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:16,931
- Cutting Boulevard, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Which way?

553
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,811
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

554
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,210
once it jettisons its food supply?

555
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:26,530
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

556
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,011
- Well, then, let's climb aboard.
- No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

557
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,050
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

558
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,170
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

559
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,410
- We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
- Yeah, bu...

560
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,649
Buzz! Buzz!

561
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,169
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

562
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,050
- Thanks for the directions, okay?
- Yeah. And remember, kid...

563
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,449
Buzz!

564
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,128
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

565
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:25,648
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

566
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:28,968
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

567
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,367
You are clear to enter.

568
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:36,127
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

569
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:39,807
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

570
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:41,287
Sheriff!

571
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,326
There you are.

572
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:47,566
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

573
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:50,725
Great idea, Woody.

574
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,846
I like your thinkin'.

575
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:56,686
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

576
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:58,365
Now!

577
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:01,125
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

578
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,765
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

579
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:05,725
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

580
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,285
Watch where you're going!

581
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:09,765
Sorry.

582
00:34:15,484 --> 00:34:19,604
Nine, eight, seven, six,

583
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:22,644
five, four, three,

584
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:24,604
two, one.

585
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,044
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

586
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:39,202
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

587
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,123
- Andy!
- Now, we need to find a ship

588
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:44,483
- that's headed for Sector 12.
- Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

589
00:34:44,562 --> 00:34:47,803
- There's a special ship. I just saw it.
- You mean it has hyperdrive?

590
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,363
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

591
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:53,242
And Astro... turf!

592
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:55,722
- Where is it? I don't see the...
- Come on. That's it.

593
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,122
Spaceship!

594
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:02,001
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

595
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,801
- And the universe explodes!
- Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

596
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,442
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

597
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:10,042
- No!
- Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

598
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:11,521
can I have some alien slime?

599
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:14,162
This cannot be happening to me.

600
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,320
- A stranger.
- From the outside.

601
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:29,641
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

602
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,040
I come in peace.

603
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,400
Before your space journey,
re-energize yourself

604
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,919
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

605
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:43,799
This is an intergalactic emergency.

606
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,199
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 12.

607
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,599
Who's in charge here?

608
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,359
The claw!

609
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,519
The claw is our master.

610
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,759
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

611
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,119
- This is ludicrous.
- Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

612
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:02,519
Take that!

613
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,719
Oh, no! Sid!

614
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:07,319
Get down!

615
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:10,838
What's gotten into you? I was...

616
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,038
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

617
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:15,438
The claw, it moves.

618
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,998
I have been chosen!

619
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:25,558
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

620
00:36:26,118 --> 00:36:27,837
Gotchal!

621
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:32,438
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

622
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:49,716
Yes!

623
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:51,516
Buzz! No!

624
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:54,155
Hey!

625
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:57,557
He has been chosen!

626
00:36:57,596 --> 00:36:59,196
- He must go.
- Hey!

627
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:00,755
- What are you doing?
- Do not fight the claw.

628
00:37:00,795 --> 00:37:02,835
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

629
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:08,915
All right!
Double prizes!

630
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:13,995
Let's go home and... play.

631
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,714
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

632
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:31,834
- You're almost home.
- Nirvana is coming.

633
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:34,394
- The mystic portal awaits.
- Will you be quiet?

634
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,874
You guys don't get it, do you?

635
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:39,114
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

636
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,554
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

637
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,633
Sit! Good boy.

638
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,354
- Hey, I got something for you, boy.
- Freeze!

639
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,833
Ready, set, now!

640
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:54,553
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

641
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:56,712
- What?
- Did I get my package in the mail?

642
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,072
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

643
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,872
I don't know!

644
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:04,552
- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
- What? Hey!

645
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,312
- She's sick!
- No, she's not!

646
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:08,751
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

647
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:11,351
- No!
- No, not Sid's room. Not there.

648
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:13,232
Hey, give her back!

649
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:15,072
Sid! Sid!

650
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:19,152
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

651
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,072
Prepare the OR, stat!

652
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:25,230
Patient is... prepped.

653
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:30,590
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

654
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,311
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

655
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:37,071
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

656
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:41,471
Doctor, you've done it!

657
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,030
Hannah!

658
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,030
Janie's all better now.

659
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,550
- Mom! Mom!
- She's lying!

660
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,150
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

661
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,709
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

662
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,748
Locked.

663
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,948
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

664
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:29,827
Buzz? Was that you?

665
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:41,387
Hey, hi there, little fella.

666
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:44,746
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

667
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:15,225
Buzz!

668
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:28,104
They're cannibals.

669
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:32,265
Mayday, mayday.

670
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:34,504
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

671
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,824
Star Command, do you copy?

672
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:39,584
I've set my laser from stun to Kill.

673
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:43,624
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

674
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:48,944
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

675
00:40:49,024 --> 00:40:51,624
Buzz, is that you?

676
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:53,663
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

677
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,463
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

678
00:40:57,862 --> 00:40:59,622
Look, they're home.

679
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:06,143
Mom, have you seen Woody?

680
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:07,742
Where was the last place
you left him?

681
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,023
Right here in the van.

682
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:11,662
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

683
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,103
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

684
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:16,463
Woody's gone?

685
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,421
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

686
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,542
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

687
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:24,662
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

688
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,742
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

689
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:36,501
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

690
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:41,260
I can see your will is strong.

691
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:45,860
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

692
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,260
Where are your rebel friends now?

693
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,180
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

694
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,779
All right!

695
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,499
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

696
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:19,139
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

697
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:22,099
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

698
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:25,299
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

699
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:27,698
The door. It's open!
We're free!

700
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:28,898
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

701
00:42:28,938 --> 00:42:30,178
I'll tell you what?

702
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:34,498
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

703
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,297
Shield your eyes.

704
00:42:38,178 --> 00:42:40,898
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

705
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:44,458
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

706
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:47,136
- Get away!
- Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

707
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:49,937
- Stop that.
- Back! Back, you savages! Back!

708
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:53,576
- Woody, stop it!
- Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

709
00:42:53,897 --> 00:42:56,376
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

710
00:42:57,216 --> 00:42:58,816
There's no place like home.

711
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,696
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

712
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:17,055
Don't tell me what to do.

713
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,974
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

714
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:41,695
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

715
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:45,654
Split up!

716
00:44:06,972 --> 00:44:09,173
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

717
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:11,293
- This is Star Command.
- Star Command!

718
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:13,812
- Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
- Buzz Lightyear responding.

719
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:14,893
Read you loud and clear.

720
00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:17,372
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

721
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,532
- On the way!
- Buzz Lightyear!

722
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:23,932
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

723
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:26,852
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

724
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:29,292
- Calling Buzz Lightyear!
- Karate chop action!

725
00:44:29,372 --> 00:44:31,291
- Wow!
- Pulsating laser light!

726
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:34,651
- Total annihilation!
- Multi-phrase voice simulator!

727
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:36,731
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

728
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,572
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:41,771
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

730
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:45,370
- To infinity and beyond!
- Not a flying toy.

731
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:47,091
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

732
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,251
- and save a galaxy near you!
- Buzz Lightyear!

733
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,690
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

734
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,890
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

735
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:05,050
Out among the stars I sail

736
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:07,690
Way beyond the moon

737
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:13,530
In my silver ship I sailed

738
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,529
To a dream
that ended too soon

739
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:20,328
Now I know exactly

740
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,769
Who I am and what I'm here for

741
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:27,129
You are a toy! You can't fly!

742
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:33,208
And I will go sailing

743
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,767
No more

744
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:45,048
But no, it can't be true

745
00:45:45,128 --> 00:45:48,167
I could fly if I wanted to

746
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:50,847
Like a bird in the sky

747
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:53,687
If I believed I could fly

748
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:56,246
Why, I'd fly

749
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:59,006
To infinity and beyond!

750
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:17,766
Clearly, I

751
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:22,366
Will go sailing

752
00:46:22,445 --> 00:46:24,925
No more

753
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:40,805
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

754
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:43,604
What, dear? What was that?

755
00:46:44,164 --> 00:46:46,204
Never mind!

756
00:46:53,204 --> 00:46:55,924
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

757
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:59,363
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

758
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,643
Really?
That is so interesting.

759
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:06,203
Would you like some tea,
Mrs. Nesbitt?

760
00:47:06,803 --> 00:47:07,763
Buzz!

761
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,643
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

762
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:14,163
- Oh, no!
- What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt.

763
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,283
It goes quite well with your head.

764
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:19,563
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

765
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,243
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

766
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:24,043
I'll be right back.

767
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:30,562
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

768
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:33,043
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

769
00:47:33,122 --> 00:47:36,202
Gonel! It's all gone.

770
00:47:36,241 --> 00:47:39,002
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

771
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:40,081
What happened to you?

772
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,721
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

773
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:46,641
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darjeeling with

774
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:49,721
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

775
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:53,801
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

776
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:55,560
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

777
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:58,481
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

778
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:03,280
- I am Mrs. Nesbitt!
- Snap out of it, Buzz!

779
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,159
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

780
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,960
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

781
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,999
I can get through this.

782
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh, I'm a sham!

783
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,119
- Look at me.
- Quiet, Buzz.

784
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,958
I can't even fly out of a window.

785
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,159
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

786
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:25,919
- The apron is a bit much.
- "Out the window"!

787
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:28,239
Buzz, you're a genius!

788
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:29,558
Come on, come on. This way.

789
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:32,679
Years of academy, training, wasted!

790
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,039
B-3.

791
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,159
Miss! G-6.

792
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,318
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

793
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:42,598
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

794
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:44,998
- Give me the nose. Come on.
- How about three out of five?

795
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:49,197
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

796
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,797
- Son of a building block. It's Woody.
- He's in the psycho's bedroom.

797
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:55,198
- Hi!
- Everyone! It's Woody!

798
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:56,278
- Woody?
- You're kidding!

799
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:59,278
- Woody?
- We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

800
00:48:59,797 --> 00:49:00,957
Buzz?

801
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:07,156
- Hey, look!
- Woody!

802
00:49:07,237 --> 00:49:09,317
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

803
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:11,917
- Knew you'd come back, Woody.
- What are you doin' over there?

804
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:14,356
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

805
00:49:14,436 --> 00:49:16,356
Here! Catch this!

806
00:49:17,436 --> 00:49:19,796
- Whoal! I've got it, Woody.
- He got it, Woody.

807
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:22,636
Good goin', Slink. Now just,
just tie it on to somethin'.

808
00:49:22,716 --> 00:49:25,115
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

809
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,476
- Hey!
- Potato Head.

810
00:49:26,556 --> 00:49:28,435
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

811
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,436
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

812
00:49:30,475 --> 00:49:31,955
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

813
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:36,275
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

814
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:38,635
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

815
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:41,835
- You are a liar!
- No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

816
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:45,515
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

817
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:49,275
Just a sec!

818
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:52,355
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

819
00:49:54,754 --> 00:49:55,754
That's very funny, Buzz.

820
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:58,795
- This is serious!
- Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

821
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:00,834
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

822
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:03,513
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

823
00:50:03,594 --> 00:50:06,554
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

824
00:50:06,634 --> 00:50:10,194
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

825
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,033
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

826
00:50:12,073 --> 00:50:16,794
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

827
00:50:16,873 --> 00:50:18,153
Give me five, man!

828
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:19,393
Something's screwy here.

829
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,193
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

830
00:50:22,273 --> 00:50:24,112
You bet. Give me a hug.

831
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:26,552
Boy, I love you too.

832
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:28,192
See? It is Buzz.

833
00:50:28,232 --> 00:50:29,832
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

834
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,272
Wait just a minute.

835
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:33,793
- What are you tryin' to pull?
- Nothing!

836
00:50:37,632 --> 00:50:39,592
- Oh, that is disgusting.
- Murderer!

837
00:50:39,672 --> 00:50:41,672
- No! No, no, no, no, no!
- You murdering dog!

838
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:44,032
- It's not what you think. I swear!
- Save it for the jury.

839
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:46,591
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

840
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,511
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

841
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:51,431
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

842
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:52,751
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

843
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:55,351
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

844
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:57,911
Come back! Slink!

845
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,790
<i>Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!</i>

846
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,991
No! No! Come back!

847
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:07,430
Slinky!

848
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,230
Buzz! Go away!

849
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:19,950
You disgusting freaks!

850
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,550
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

851
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:31,630
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

852
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,430
<i>What are you don'?</i>

853
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:38,229
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

854
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:43,148
But they're cannibals.

855
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:45,668
We saw them eat
those other toys.

856
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:56,108
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

857
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:58,668
You know, you know, eat my friend.

858
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:00,747
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

859
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,188
- What's wrong?
- Sid?

860
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:03,907
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

861
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:06,308
- Sid! Buzz, come on!
- You left that door open.

862
00:52:06,348 --> 00:52:10,587
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

863
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:15,907
It came!
It finally came!

864
00:52:18,986 --> 00:52:20,546
"The Big One."

865
00:52:23,386 --> 00:52:25,746
"Extremely dangerous.

866
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:28,427
"Keep out of reach of children."

867
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:32,786
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

868
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:35,626
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

869
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:54,144
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

870
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:05,585
Now. Yes.

871
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,704
Oh, no!

872
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:15,744
Oh, man!

873
00:53:22,143 --> 00:53:23,824
Sid Phillips reporting.

874
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:25,383
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

875
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:28,063
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

876
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:30,862
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

877
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:33,942
Sweet dreams.

878
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:42,462
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

879
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:44,622
But what if we
leave them behind?

880
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,382
Oh, don't worry, honey.

881
00:53:46,462 --> 00:53:49,742
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

882
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,942
I need air!

883
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,021
Will you quit movin' around?

884
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:04,581
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
l get so nervous before I travel.

885
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,981
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

886
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,141
Everyone else was picked.

887
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:16,901
Oh, Woody.

888
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,620
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

889
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:36,620
Hey, Buzz!

890
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:46,619
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

891
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,938
Oh, come on, Buzz, ll...

892
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,978
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

893
00:54:57,578 --> 00:55:00,697
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

894
00:55:00,738 --> 00:55:03,498
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

895
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:06,778
Then [I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

896
00:55:06,857 --> 00:55:10,258
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

897
00:55:10,297 --> 00:55:14,217
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

898
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:17,658
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

899
00:55:17,697 --> 00:55:20,258
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

900
00:55:20,337 --> 00:55:24,377
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

901
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:25,657
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

902
00:55:25,737 --> 00:55:29,017
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

903
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:31,337
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is.

904
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:34,337
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

905
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,016
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

906
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:40,816
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

907
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:42,416
But why would Andy want me?

908
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:47,575
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

909
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:50,256
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

910
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:53,695
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

911
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:57,015
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

912
00:55:57,575 --> 00:56:00,055
You are a cool toy.

913
00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:06,135
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

914
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,814
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

915
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:13,054
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

916
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:15,614
All ll can do is...

917
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:19,933
There's a snake in my boots.

918
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:22,254
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

919
00:56:22,294 --> 00:56:24,894
when he's got you?

920
00:56:25,654 --> 00:56:29,173
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

921
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:53,972
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

922
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:56,851
You should get outta here
while you can.

923
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:09,651
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

924
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:12,611
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

925
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:14,611
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

926
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:15,971
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

927
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,490
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

928
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,010
Woody, it's the moving van.

929
00:57:28,051 --> 00:57:30,130
We gotta get outta here now.

930
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:36,329
Come on, Buzz.

931
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:39,010
All right.

932
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,089
- Hey, I'm out!
- Almost there.

933
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:50,129
I want to ride the pony.

934
00:57:54,129 --> 00:57:57,529
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

935
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:00,849
I'm fine. I'm okay.

936
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:14,288
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

937
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:19,888
To infinity and beyond!

938
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:30,647
Back, back.

939
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:32,407
Down, down!

940
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:35,046
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

941
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:39,246
Guys!

942
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,366
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

943
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:44,686
There's a good toy down there,

944
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:47,766
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

945
00:58:47,846 --> 00:58:51,245
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

946
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:53,966
And...
But I need your help.

947
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:03,605
Please. He's my friend.

948
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:06,885
And he's the only one I've got.

949
00:59:19,564 --> 00:59:23,084
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

950
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:25,164
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

951
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:28,243
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

952
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:41,363
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

953
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:44,682
Launch pad is being constructed.

954
00:59:46,322 --> 00:59:47,482
All right, listen up.

955
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:50,283
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

956
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:52,922
Legs, you're with Ducky.

957
00:59:53,642 --> 00:59:56,202
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

958
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:59,602
Okay. Let's move!

959
01:00:19,642 --> 01:00:20,721
Wind the frog.

960
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,040
Wait for the signal.

961
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,238
Go!

962
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:05,478
All right, let's go!

963
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:07,438
I'll get it!

964
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:08,679
Now!

965
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:11,078
I'm coming. I'm coming.

966
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:21,958
Scud!

967
01:01:25,957 --> 01:01:27,557
Stupid dog.

968
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:36,477
Lean back!

969
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,516
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

970
01:01:44,557 --> 01:01:47,036
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

971
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:50,557
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

972
01:01:50,596 --> 01:01:52,276
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

973
01:01:52,356 --> 01:01:54,516
- Stand by.
- Let's go.

974
01:01:54,596 --> 01:01:58,676
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

975
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:01,116
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

976
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:04,916
- What?
- It's okay. Everything's under control.

977
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:07,555
Woody, what are you doing?

978
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:11,714
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

979
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:14,955
Hey? How'd you get out here?

980
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:19,475
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

981
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:25,274
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

982
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:27,754
Roger. Permission granted.

983
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:31,794
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

984
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:35,474
And counting.
Ten, nine,

985
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:38,234
eight, seven, six,

986
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:41,313
five, four, three, two,

987
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:45,312
- one!
- Reach for the sky!

988
01:02:46,673 --> 01:02:49,993
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

989
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:51,353
What?

990
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,913
<i>Somebody's poisoned the water hole.</i>

991
01:02:53,952 --> 01:02:57,792
- It's busted.
- Who are you callin' busted, buster?

992
01:02:58,713 --> 01:02:59,793
That's right.

993
01:02:59,872 --> 01:03:03,432
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

994
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:06,232
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

995
01:03:06,272 --> 01:03:08,192
or smashed or ripped apart.

996
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:11,552
_llWell?
- That's right! Your toys!

997
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:13,792
Mamal

998
01:03:14,271 --> 01:03:15,552
Mamal

999
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:19,071
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

1000
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,230
Mamal

1001
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:46,151
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1002
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:50,149
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1003
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:56,310
We toys can see everything.

1004
01:03:57,429 --> 01:03:59,709
So play nice.

1005
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:09,149
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1006
01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:11,708
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1007
01:04:11,988 --> 01:04:13,389
Nice toy.

1008
01:04:17,068 --> 01:04:18,388
What's wrong, Sid?

1009
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:21,068
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1010
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:24,307
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1011
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:26,828
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1012
01:04:26,907 --> 01:04:28,547
Woody.

1013
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:31,227
Thanks.

1014
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:34,668
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1015
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,947
- Woody! The van!
- Bye, house.

1016
01:04:39,747 --> 01:04:41,347
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1017
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:45,948
Quick!

1018
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:52,746
Just go. I'll catch up.

1019
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:14,426
Come on!

1020
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,064
You can do it, Woody!

1021
01:05:33,224 --> 01:05:34,904
I got it!

1022
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:36,984
I made it.

1023
01:05:41,224 --> 01:05:44,104
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1024
01:05:44,184 --> 01:05:46,663
- Down!
- Hold on, Woody!

1025
01:05:47,863 --> 01:05:50,183
I can't do it.

1026
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:53,463
Take care of Andy for me!

1027
01:05:53,543 --> 01:05:55,023
No!

1028
01:05:56,343 --> 01:05:57,702
Buzz!

1029
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:24,941
Are we there already?

1030
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,501
- Woody?
- How did you...?

1031
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:27,861
- How'd he get here?
- Where have you...?

1032
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,141
What happened?

1033
01:06:29,181 --> 01:06:31,221
- What's goin' on?
- What's he takin'?

1034
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,301
There you are!

1035
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,140
Hey. What's he doing?

1036
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:39,781
He's at it again!

1037
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,819
- Get him!
- Come on!

1038
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,540
No, no!

1039
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:08,339
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoal!

1040
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:17,819
Pig pile!

1041
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:41,218
- Get outta that car!
- Move it!

1042
01:07:43,337 --> 01:07:45,216
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1043
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:47,256
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1044
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:49,617
- No!
- Toss him overboard!

1045
01:07:49,657 --> 01:07:51,337
No, no, no! Wait!

1046
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:56,137
- Hooray!
- So long, Woody!

1047
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:03,017
Oh! Woody!

1048
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:06,256
- Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
- Look out!

1049
01:08:09,816 --> 01:08:12,135
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1050
01:08:19,215 --> 01:08:21,776
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1051
01:08:21,815 --> 01:08:23,856
- What?
- And Buzz is with him!

1052
01:08:27,975 --> 01:08:29,094
It is Buzz!

1053
01:08:29,135 --> 01:08:31,055
Woody was telling the truth.

1054
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:34,415
- What have we done?
- Great! Now I have guilt.

1055
01:08:34,454 --> 01:08:36,494
We're almost there!

1056
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,775
Rocky, the ramp!

1057
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:48,534
Look out!

1058
01:08:49,294 --> 01:08:51,573
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1059
01:08:56,494 --> 01:09:01,294
- Attaboy, Slink!
- Oh! Woody!

1060
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:02,692
Woody! Speed up!

1061
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:04,613
- Speed up!
- The batteries!

1062
01:09:04,653 --> 01:09:06,252
They're runnin' out!

1063
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:25,731
- I can't hold on much longer.
- Slink! Hang on!

1064
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,051
Great!

1065
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:46,570
Woody! The rocket!

1066
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:49,050
The match! Yes!

1067
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,930
Thank you, Sid!

1068
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,810
No! No, no! No!

1069
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,209
No! Oh, no!

1070
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:06,970
No, no, no, no, no,

1071
01:10:07,049 --> 01:10:08,730
no!

1072
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,449
No!

1073
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:22,089
- Woody! What are you doing?
- Hold still, Buzz!

1074
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:25,689
You did it!

1075
01:10:26,049 --> 01:10:27,568
Next stop, Andy!

1076
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:31,568
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1077
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:44,088
I should have held on longer.

1078
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:47,168
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1079
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:49,567
Woody!

1080
01:10:58,207 --> 01:10:59,607
Take cover!

1081
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:08,646
This is the part
where we blow up!

1082
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:10,086
Not today!

1083
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:23,325
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'l

1084
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:26,526
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1085
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:33,205
To infinity and beyond!

1086
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:41,125
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1087
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:43,205
We're not aiming for the truck.

1088
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:50,684
Hey, wow!

1089
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:52,845
- What? What is it?
- Woody! Buzz!

1090
01:11:52,924 --> 01:11:54,884
<i>Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?</i>

1091
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:56,965
- Here in the car!
- See?

1092
01:11:57,004 --> 01:12:00,163
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1093
01:12:08,483 --> 01:12:11,924
- Which one can I open first?
- Let's let Molly open one.

1094
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:18,843
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1095
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:21,122
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1096
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,003
Whoal! It's time!

1097
01:12:24,962 --> 01:12:26,323
Oh, Bo.

1098
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:28,722
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1099
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:30,802
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1100
01:12:31,882 --> 01:12:34,202
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1101
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:40,001
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1102
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:43,281
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1103
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:44,361
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1104
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:48,001
Molly's first present
is Mrs. Potato Head.

1105
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,001
Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head.

1106
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:52,081
Way to go, Idaho!

1107
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:54,120
Gee, I'd better shave.

1108
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,000
Come in, Frankincense.

1109
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,961
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1110
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,760
- It's...
- Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1111
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,720
- you are not worried, are you?
- I can't quite...

1112
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:08,159
- Me? No, no.
- Make out...

1113
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,759
No. No, no, no, no.

1114
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,119
A large box... It's...

1115
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,680
- Are you?
- Now, Buzz,

1116
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,799
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1117
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,759
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1118
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:24,679
Wow! A puppy!

1119
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,238
You've got a friend in me

1120
01:13:43,478 --> 01:13:46,398
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:50,598
When the road looks rough ahead

1122
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:55,357
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1123
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,717
You just remember
what your old pal said

1124
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:01,437
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1125
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:06,397
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:14:11,556 --> 01:14:14,436
You've got a friend in me

1127
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:18,077
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:23,556
- You got troubles
- And I got 'em too

1129
01:14:23,636 --> 01:14:27,516
There isn't anything
! wouldn't do for you

1130
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,516
If we stick together
we can see it through

1131
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:33,755
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1132
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:37,955
You've got a friend in me

1133
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,515
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1134
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:46,475
Bigger and stronger too

1135
01:14:46,555 --> 01:14:47,595
Maybe

1136
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:53,114
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1137
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:55,674
It's me and you, boy

1138
01:14:55,714 --> 01:14:59,034
And as the years go by

1139
01:14:59,074 --> 01:15:02,034
Our friendship will never die

1140
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:08,153
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1141
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:12,033
You've got a friend in me

1142
01:15:12,114 --> 01:15:14,554
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:15:16,153 --> 01:15:18,473
You've got a friend in me
